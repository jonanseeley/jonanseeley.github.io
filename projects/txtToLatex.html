        <h1>txtToLaTeX</h1>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I was sitting in my Global Histories lecture in the Spring semester of my Freshman year, and I was frustrated by writing all my notes in a notebook.  I'm awful when it comes to writing things quickly by hand, so slides were passing by before I was able to take all the notes I wanted to take.  Given that the class was heavily structured around these lectures and no notes or slides were posted online, I decided to start taking notes on my computer instead.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;While I know that studies have shown that people tend to retain information more poorly when they take notes using a computer compared to taking notes via the more classic pen and paper, I had to choose between better retention of the information I was able to write down and missing information or retaining all the information more poorly but having a full set of notes to look back on.  Given that I'm writing this post, you can probably assume which choice I made.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;While I was more than happy to take notes using my computer since I enjoy typing, I wanted to use Vim in order to practice using the editor and since Microsoft Word has failed me more times than I'd like to remember.  While writing notes in a simple .txt file would be easiest, it surely wasn't the prettiest or easiest to read during review.  I had been using LaTeX recently so I tried my hand at directly writing LaTeX code during lecture.  Evidently, I realized that probably wasn't the best idea and decided to just write everything in text files with tabs to denote where a normal outline would indent.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;At this point, I realized I could just write a Python script to transform the notes I was taking into pretty LaTeX code.  So that's exactly what I did.</p>

        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The above text document may be filled with information, but at least I find it very annoying to read, and I probably wouldn't want to be looking through a bunch of text files while reviewing.  So instead, after processing the file through txtToLaTeX, it looks much more presentable.</p>

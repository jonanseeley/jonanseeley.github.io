        <h2>triviaBot</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This was a project I did on a whim after thinking about how to automate solving HQ Trivia questions.  The basic concept is that the script ingests a screenshot of the user's phone and parses the text on screen using the open source OCR tool Tesseract.  The script then makes formatted Google searches to determine its best guess for the correct answer.</p>
        <h3><a href="projects/triviaBot.html">Read more . . .</a></h3>
        <h2>txtToLaTeX</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I wrote this short program since I wanted to take notes in Vim but didn't want to have to review them in Vim.  The script is fairly simple as it just parses a text file and interprets tabs as depth in a bulleted list format.  I found it useful in my classes, so I figured I would release it in case anyone else found themselves in a similar use case.</p>

        <h2>Boggle</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I wanted to get more experience with web development in my spare time and my family loves Boggle, so I decided to develop an implementation of the classic game in Django.  This project is still in development, so keep that in mind if you take a look at the messy code in the repository.</p>

        <h2>Scrabble Wordlist Getter</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;While working on my Boggle project, I wanted a reputable word list to check user submissions against.  After not having luck finding one online, I decided to scrape the Merriam Online Scrabble Dictionary myself.</p>

        <h2>General Knowledge Quiz</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;After hearing about a study that quizzed American college students on general knowledge, I was bummed to find out that the formatting of the study made the quiz hard to take on your own.  I decided to make a small Javascript-powered site to allow for easier quizzing.</p>

        <h2>triviaBot</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This was a project I did on a whim after thinking about how to automate solving HQ Trivia questions.  The basic concept is that the script ingests a screenshot of the user's phone and parses the text on screen using the open source OCR tool Tesseract.  The script then makes formatted Google searches to determine its best guess for the correct answer.</p>

        <h2>txtToLaTeX</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I wrote this short program since I wanted to take notes in Vim but didn't want to have to review them in Vim.  The script is fairly simple as it just parses a text file and interprets tabs as depth in a bulleted list format.  I found it useful in my classes, so I figured I would release it in case anyone else found themselves in a similar use case.</p>
